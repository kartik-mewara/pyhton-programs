# The biggest difference between list and tuple is that tuples are immutable and we cant change them and syntex is a=() is like this
# t=() empty tuple
# t=(1,) single element tuple in this we have to apply this "," comma with single element to make it identufy that it is tuple 
t=(1,78,54,32,12,30,1,"eudh")
print(t)
print(t[1])
print(t[1:])
print(t.count(1)) #it counts the occurance of the element entered
print(t.index("eudh"))#find the index of the element entered
